### mlp-exp

This is a personal project, the package is designed for setting up MLP experiments in a simple pipeline. 
I use it in my PhD research for analyzing dynamics of coordinate-based MLPs. 

For guidance on how to use mlp-exp, please refer to this Colab notebook: [mlp-exp usage explained](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H05Z8CoTsp12HJS3Rl6n8lE4QFifi4xp#scrollTo=FjM0epbTUito).
