### NNES: Neural Network Experimental Suite

This PyTorch package is designed for setting up experiments in a simple pipeline. 
I use it in my PhD research for analyzing coordinate-based MLPs. 
NNES is a personal project in a very early stage of development, and I provide no guarantees on its functionality.

For guidance on how to use NNES, please refer to this Colab notebook: [NNES Usage Explained](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H05Z8CoTsp12HJS3Rl6n8lE4QFifi4xp#scrollTo=FjM0epbTUito).
